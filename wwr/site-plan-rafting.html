        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website will be to increase business revenue and provide a better customer 
            experience. The website will allow more people to access our services and make it easy to book 
            their excursion. Additionally, their experience will be better because we will be able to provide 
            information about what they can expect and what they will neeed in order to be fully prepared.
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>Who are the target customers? The target customers are people of all ages but the majority 
            will probably be between 18 and 50. Likely some families and business associates. They would 
            like to do things like hike, camp, ski, mountain climb, kayak, etc. They are NOT financially 
            strained. This would range from having a vacation fund to be used once a year to having more 
            money than they know what to do with.
            What do they want? They want something different. They want thrill! They also want to be 
            prepared and feel safe.
            What do they expect to find or what questions will be answered by them accessing the website? 
            They, like most, will expect to find information about what exactly will be happening, when
            it will happening, where it will be happening, and the amount of time they can should plan on. 
            They will expect to find information on each potential river trip and how they differ. They 
            will expect to find information for what is NOT provided and what they need to keep in mind to 
            be safe. They expect to find pictures or videos of the activity and a place to make their 
            reservation.
